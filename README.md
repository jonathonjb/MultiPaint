Allows people to have paint on a canvas

This project has both, the Server program and the Client program.

First, you will have to run the Server class, which uses the port number, 41217.

Then, you would have to run the Paint class. This will connect to the server on port 41217, and then initialize a canvas. You are able to paint anywhere on this canvas, and the paint will appear on all of the canvases that is connected to the server.

Note: Currently, this program only works on the "localhost" ip address, which means everything can only be done on a single computer. If you would like this program to work on multiple computers, then you would have to assign an IP address to the server.
